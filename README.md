## Philosophy

:orange_book: The basic concept of our quantum program is an array of quantum circuits. The program workflow consists of three stages: Build, Compile, and Run. Build allows you to make different quantum circuits that represent the problem you are solving. Compile allows you to rewrite them to run on different backends (simulators/real chips of different quantum volumes, sizes, fidelity, etc); and Run launches the jobs. After the jobs have been run, the data is collected. There are methods for putting this data together, depending on the program. This either gives you the answer you wanted or allows you to make a better program for the next instance.

If you want to learn more about Quantum Computing, you're invited to visit our [Quamtum Experience](https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net) project.

## Structure

:handbag: The components of this repository are exposed as these libraries:

* [qiskit](./packages/qiskit): Meta-package, documented in this file. It also includes a command line client, which is your friend if you want to play with all these features without having to use any programming language.
* [@qiskit/devs](./packages/qiskit-devs): High level algorithms, thought for developers.
  * [@qiskit/devs-js](./packages/qiskit-devs-js): JavaScript engine.
  * [@qiskit/devs-anu](./packages/qiskit-devs-anu): [Australian National University](http://www.anu.edu.au) [Quantum Random Numbers Server](https://qrng.anu.edu.au) engine.
  * [@qiskit/devs-ibm](./packages/qiskit-devs-ibm): Quantum Experience engine.
* [@qiskit/cloud](./packages/qiskit-cloud): Library to make easier the interaction with the Quantum Experience.
* [@qiskit/utils](./packages/qiskit-utils): Helpers shared among all packages.
* [@qiskit/qasm](./packages/qiskit-qasm): Some [OpenQASM](https://github.com/IBM/qiskit-openqasm) tools, like parser.
* [@qiskit/sim](./packages/qiskit-sim): An experimental JS simulator for OpenQASM circuits we're working on.

### Qiskit for the browser

:inbox_tray: All components are compatible with [browserify](http://browserify.org).

## Install

:coffee: Install lastest [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/download) stable version (or LTS) and then:

```sh
npm i -g qiskit
```

## Use

### CLI

:rocket: The command line client allows to play with the circuits without having to use any programming language API.

```sh
qiskitjs --help
```
```
qiskitjs <command>

Commands:
  backend [name] - Get latest calibration stats for a backend  [aliases: b]
  backends [onlySims] - Get latest calibration stats for a backend  [aliases: bs]
  calibration [backend] - Get latest calibration stats for a backend  [aliases: c]
  circuit <circuit> [backend] [shots] [name] [seed] [maxCredits] - Send the circuit to be run in the Quantum
  	Experience (https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net)  [aliases: ci]
  credits - Information about your credits  [aliases: cr]
  factor <number> - Calculate a factor of a number  [aliases: f]
  job <id> - Get the info of a specific job  [aliases: j]
  jobs [limit] [offset] - Get all your jobs. Ordered by creation date  [aliases: js]
  login [printToken] - Use an API key to get a token to make requests  [aliases: l]
  params [backend] - Get latest parameter stats for a backend  [aliases: p]
  parse <circuit> - Parse the circuit to our IR (intermediate representation - JSON format)  [aliases: p]
  queue [backend] - Get the status of a backend queue  [aliases: q]
  random [engine] [length] [format] [backend] - Generate a true random number among 0 and 1  [aliases: r]
  result <jobId> - Get the result of a background job generated by an algorithm method. The engine is ommited
  	because IBM Q is the unique which uses background jobs for now  [aliases: re]

Options:
  --help     Show help                                                 [boolean]
  --version  Show version number                                       [boolean]
```

### Programatically

:pencil: As you can see in the next section, we have to use it like in the rest of independent modules. The only difference is we need to select the proper field of the main object before.

```js
const qiskit = require('qiskit');

console.log('True random numbers\n');

qiskit.devs.random().then(rand => console.log(`JavaScript: ${rand}`));

const cloud = new qiskit.Cloud();
cloud.login('YOUR_PERSONAL_TOKEN_HERE').then(() => {
  cloud.backends().then(data => {
    console.log('(IBM Backends');
    console.log(data);
  });

  qiskit.devs.random({
    engine: 'ibm',
    custom: cloud,
    // default: simulator
    // engine: "ibmqx4"
  }).then(rand => console.log(`IBM Cloud: ${rand}`))
});

qiskit.devs.random({
  engine: 'anu',
  length: 8,
}).then(rand => console.log(`ANU Server: ${rand}`));
```
